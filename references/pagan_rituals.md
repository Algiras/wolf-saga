# Historical Reference: Pagan Rituals

## Sacred Spaces (The Alkas)
*   **Kernavė & Romuva**: The central spiritual heartlands.
*   **Holy Groves**: Lithuanians did not build stone temples. They worshipped in oak groves. To cut an oak was to kill a god.
*   **The Eternal Fire**: Maintained by "Vaidilutės" (priestesses). If the fire went out, the nation would fall.

## Rituals of War
*   **Casting of Lots**: Before a campaign, the priests would cast dice or look at the livers of sacrificed animals to see if Perkūnas favored the raid.
*   **Consecration of Blades**: Swords and shields were washed in holy spring water.

## Funerary Customs (The Pyre)
*   **Cremation**: High-ranking dukes were burned on massive pyres in sacred groves.
*   **Sacrifice**: Rumors (often spread by Teutonic chronicles) suggested that favored horses, weapons, and even servants were burned with the lord.
*   **The Amber Path**: Amber dust was thrown into the fire to guide the soul to the afterlife.

## The Seasonal Cycles
*   **October (Vėlinės)**: The time of the dead. Feasts were set out for the ancestors.
*   **Midsummer (Rasos)**: Celebration of the sun and fertility.
