### Part I: The Vacuum (1430–1432)
*Focus: The immediate chaos following Vytautas’s death and the broken promises of the crown.*

1.  **Chapter 1: Paskutinis Atodūsis (The Last Breath)**: Trakai, 1430. Vytautas dies in the arms of his servants. A massive, unnatural silence falls over the GDL. The Iron Wolf is seen for the last time on the island of Trakai, dissolving into mist.
2.  **Chapter 2: Karūnos Šešėlis (Shadow of the Crown)**: The Polish envoys and local nobles argue over the body. Švitrigaila, the mercurial brother of Jogaila, seizes power. He represents the "raw" power of the East.
3.  **Chapter 3: Švitrigailos Pakilimas (The Rise of Švitrigaila)**: Unlike Vytautas, Švitrigaila does not use subtlety. He begins mobilizing the Ruthenian (Eastern) lords, challenging the Polish influence.
4.  **Chapter 4: Jogailos Dvejonė (Jogaila’s Hesitation)**: In Krakow, the aging King Jogaila watches his brother's rise with fear. The **Shadow-Seller** appears in his dreams, reminding him of Kęstutis.
5.  **Chapter 5: Senieji Balsai (The Old Voices)**: Flashback to 1345. Algirdas and Kęstutis making their "Silent Pact" in the sacred grove of Romuva. The origin of the GDL’s mystical protection.
6.  **Chapter 6: Sąmokslas Trakre (The Trakai Conspiracy)**: Lithuanian nobles, led by Žygimantas Kęstutaitis (Vytautas's brother), feel sidelined by Švitrigaila's Eastern focus. The **Jester Henne** begins whispering in Žygimantas's ears.
7.  **Chapter 7: Nakties Perversmas (The Night Coup)**: August 1432. Žygimantas Kęstutaitis seizes power in a bloody night attack in Ashmyany. Švitrigaila barely escapes to the East.

### Part II: The Civil War (1432–1435)
*Focus: The brutal divide between West (Lithuania Proper) and East (Ruthenia), and the bloody climax.*

8.  **Chapter 8: Perskelta Šalis (A Country Divided)**: The GDL splits in two. One half for the Cross and the King; the other for the Orthodox cross and the "Wild" East.
9.  **Chapter 9: Žygimanto Šaltis (The Cold of Žygimantas)**: Žygimantas Kęstutaitis becomes Grand Duke. He is haunted by the feeling that he is a "replacement" for Vytautas. He begins a reign of terror against the nobles.
10. **Chapter 10: Švitrigailos Kerštas (Švitrigaila’s Revenge)**: Gathering an army of Livonian riteriai, Ruthenian princes, and Tatars. He promises a return to the "Old GDL" (pre-Baptism autonomy).
11. **Chapter 11: Šaknų Motinos Sugrįžimas (Return of the Root-Mother)**: In the deep forests, the old magic begins to act up. Trees block paths; wolves attack only those carrying "foreign" seals. A final attempt by the forest to intervene.
12. **Chapter 12: Žygiai per Pelenus (Marches through Ashes)**: The countryside is ravaged. The civil war is more brutal than any Teutonic invasion. Brother against brother, mirroring the 1382 conflict.
13. **Chapter 13: Pabaisko Laukas (The Field of Pabaiskas)**: September 1435. The decisive battle near Ukmergė. The landscape matches the carnage of Grunwald, but without the glory. 
14. **Chapter 14: Mirėjas Ordinas (The Dying Order)**: The Livonian Order is crushed at Pabaiskas. The "Geležinis Šventasis" (Iron Saint) is finally silenced in the North.
15. **Chapter 15: Švitrigailos Žlugimas (The Fall of Švitrigaila)**: Defeated and broken, Švitrigaila flees to the South. The dream of an Eastern-leaning GDL ends in the mud.

### Part III: The Ghost of the Wolf (1435–1440)
*Focus: The dark reign of Žygimantas Kęstutaitis and the psychological toll of the legacy.*

16. **Chapter 16: Triumfas be Džiaugsmo (Triumph without Joy)**: Žygimantas rules as the undisputed Grand Duke, but the nobility hates him. He is plagued by visions of his father Kęstutis in the Krėva dungeons.
17. **Chapter 17: Auksinio Smauglio Puota (Feast of the Gold-Glutton)**: Corruption spreads. The magnates (Goštautai, Radvilos) begin amassing power through land grants and bribes.
18. **Chapter 18: Paranojos Pilis (Castle of Paranoia)**: Žygimantas hides in Trakai. He suspects everyone of being a "Shadow-Seller" agent. Every shadow is an assassin.
19. **Chapter 19: Jogailos Pabaiga (The End of Jogaila)**: 1434. Jogaila dies in Poland. The last of the original three cousins is gone. The **Jester Henne** performs a final act at his funeral.
20. **Chapter 20: Išdavystės Aidas (Echo of Betrayal)**: Flashback to 1382. Kęstutis's death. Žygimantas recalls the feeling of the golden chain. He decides to eliminate all potential rivals.
21. **Chapter 21: Bajorų Maištas (The Nobility’s Revolt)**: 1440. The aristocrats realize that the Grand Duke is no longer a protector but a predator. They plot his assassination.
22. **Chapter 22: Kraujas ant Trakų Akmenų (Blood on Trakai Stones)**: March 1440. Žygimantas Kęstutaitis is murdered in Trakai Island Castle. The Iron Wolf is heard howling in the deep ežeras (lake).

### Part IV: The New Era (1440–1450)
*Focus: The transition to the Jagiellonian era and the vanishing of the mystical world.*

23. **Chapter 23: Vaikas Soste (A Child on the Throne)**: Casimir, the son of Jogaila, is elected Grand Duke. He is young, naive, and represents a "clean slate."
24. **Chapter 24: Magistrų Pelenai (Ashes of the Masters)**: The Teutonic Order becomes a mere vassal state. The era of the Crusades is officially over. The "Geležinis Vartai" (Iron Gates) are now just a trade entrance.
25. **Chapter 25: Gintaro Karalienės Tylėjimas (Silence of the Amber Queen)**: Palanga, 1445. The amber statue of Birutė is found by fishermen, but it no longer glows. The sea has taken its magic back.
26. **Chapter 26: Raštas prieš Burtus (Ink against Spells)**: The First Lithuanian Statute begins to take form. Laws, documents, and seals replace the personal oath and the mystical omen.
27. **Chapter 27: Paskutinė Žynio Giesmė (The Last Priest’s Song)**: Galminas dies in a forgotten grove. His death marks the literal end of the old priesthood. No one is there to hear his final prophecy.
28. **Chapter 28: Mirtingas Paveldas (Mortal Inheritance)**: Vytautas's vision of a Great Empire is now a reality of bureaucracy and tax collection. The "Lion of the North" is a heraldry symbol, not a living force.
29. **Chapter 29: Šešėlių Pardavėjo Pasitraukimas (Departure of the Shadow-Seller)**: Jester Henne appears once more to a young Casimir, offering a "deal." Casimir refuses, or perhaps, doesn't even see him. The era of deals for the soul is over.
30. **Chapter 30: Epilogas: Vilko Sugrįžimas (Epilogue: Return of the Wolf)**: A young boy in the 16th century hears a story about a Geležinis Vilkas. He asks if it was real. The grandfather smiles sadly. "Kai miškai buvo žali, jis buvo. Dabar jis tik tavo sapnuose." The cycle closes, but the spirit remains in the land.

**The Atrocity of Book V**: The Battle of Pabaiskas — a slaughter of kin worse than the crusades, where the GDL almost commits suicide out of internal greed.
**The Myth of Book V**: The "Ghosting" of the world — magic doesn't die by fire, it dies by being forgotten and replaced by bureaucracy.
