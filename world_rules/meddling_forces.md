# The Meddling Forces: Ancient Powers & Silent Gods

In the world of "Lithium Thrones," the gods are not distant myths; they are hungry, active, and deeply invested in the outcome of the war.

## 1. The Root-Mother (The Forest Consciousness)
*   **Manifestation**: Deep groans in the earth, roots that shift at night, blood-red sap in the oaks.
*   **Agenda**: The preservation of the primordial "Green Lung" of the North. She hates the iron of the knights and the stone of the cities.
*   **Meddling**: She trips the feet of invaders and hides the paths of those she favors. She demands the "Amber Debt"—royal blood for every acre lost to the plow or the axe.

## 2. Perkūnas's Wrath (The Storm-Force)
*   **Manifestation**: Lightning that strikes only battle-banners, thunder that sounds like the name of a traitor.
*   **Agenda**: Justice, War, and Purity. He is a fickle protector who will strike his own followers if they show cowardice.
*   **Meddling**: He clears the fog for a righteous charge or blinds an army with a sudden strike. He speaks through the High Priestess, but his messages are often riddles of fire.

## 3. The Shadow-Seller (A shard of Velnias)
*   **Manifestation**: A figure seen at the edge of the campfire, a voice that sounds like your own conscience.
*   **Agenda**: Chaos and the acquisition of souls. He loves a "pragmatic" deal that saves a life today but ruins a nation tomorrow.
*   **Meddling**: He provides the "easy way out"—a secret treaty, a key to a dungeon, a poison that leaves no trace. Every gift comes with a "thread" attached.

## 4. The White Silence (The Twined Saint)
*   **Manifestation**: Frost flowers on swords, a blinding white light in the center of a cathedral, the smell of lilies on a frozen battlefield.
*   **Agenda**: The absolute Dominion of the Order. She seeks to "bleach" the world of its pagan colors. 
*   **Meddling**: She brings the "Crusader's Winter"—early snows that starve the pagan defenders. She grants a terrifying lack of fear to the Iron Knights, turning them into unfeeling machines of war.

## 5. The Amber Queen (The Memory of the Sea)
*   **Manifestation**: Foam on the Baltic waves, amber pieces appearing in the hands of the lost.
*   **Agenda**: Grief and Memory. She preserves the stories of those the other gods have forgotten.
*   **Meddling**: She grants visions of the past and future. She is the one who whispered the prison-break plan to Anna.

# The Vulture Gods: Invading Forces

Beyond the borders of Lithuania, other gods hunger for the "Green Lung" and the souls within it. Their influence explains the most brutal atrocities of the era.

## 6. The Iron Saint (Teutonic Manifestation)
*   **Name**: Sanctus Ferrum
*   **Agenda**: Total homogeneity. It views the "wild" and the "pagan" as a chaotic sickness to be purged.
*   **Explanation for Atrocities**: The massacres of Samogitian villages and the forced baptisms in the snow are fueled by this entity. It feeds on the "order" created by the destruction of the old world. It is a god of the furnace and the sword.

## 7. The Steppe-Hunger (The Golden Horde's Shadow)
*   **Name**: Erdene-Chuluu (The Jewel-Stone) / The Black Khan
*   **Agenda**: Dissolution. It seeks to break the "walls" of civilization and turn the world back into a vast, unmapped grassland of blood and horse-hair.
*   **Explanation for Atrocities**: The catastrophic slaughter at the Vorskla River (Book 2) and the mass execution of prisoners by Edigu are fueled by this hunger. It feeds on the hubris of kings who think they can "conquer" the horizon. It turns the battlefield into a literal "altar of dust."

## 8. The Gold-Glutton (The Merchant God)
*   **Name**: Mercator-Rex
*   **Agenda**: Profit. It views the landscape not as sacred, but as a resource.
*   **Explanation for Atrocities**: The betrayal by the Polish and Hungarian lords, the theft of the crown, and the selling of Samogitia for silver are driven by this cold, calculating force. It turns men into ledger entries.
