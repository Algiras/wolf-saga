# Svitrigaila (The Storm-Bringer)

**True Name**: Bolesław / Švitrigaila
**Title**: Duke of Vitebsk, Rival Grand Duke
**Age**: 13-17 (during the early Civil War years)
**Archetype**: The Rebellious Youth / The Chaotic Pretender

## Appearance
*   Lanky and restless. He looks like a younger, more frantic version of Jogaila.
*   Quick to anger, often flush with blood when challenged.
*   Often seen with a mismatch of gear—part Lithuanian fur, part Polish silk, part Rus' chainmail.

## Personality
*   **Ambitious & Unstable**: He wants everything his brothers have, but lacks the patience or tact to get it.
*   **Unpredictable**: Will ally with his worst enemies (the Teutonic Order) just for a chance at a throne.
*   **Resentful**: Feels sidelined by Jogaila and Skirgaila.

## Motivation
*   **Grandeur**: He believes himself destined for the Grand Ducal throne.
*   **Vengeance**: Primarily against his cousins and brothers who he feels have denied him his "fair share".
