# Tokhtamysh (The Exile Khan)

**Title**: Khan of the Golden Horde (Deposed)
**Era**: Book III (The Iron Wolf's Exile)
**Archetype**: The Fallen King / The Desperate Ally

## Appearance
*   Dressed in tattered but fine silk robes and a silver-plate headdress.
*   Wears his beard in the Mongol style.
*   Once a figure of immense power, now he looks hunted, his eyes reflecting the loss of an empire.

## Personality
*   **Arrogant & Proud**: Even in exile, he treats Vytautas as an equal or even a subordinate, which creates friction.
*   **Vengeful**: His only goal is to reclaim the Horde and see Timur and Edigu's heads on spears.
*   **Unreliable**: He makes grand promises of tribute and territory that he no longer truly controls.

## Motivation
*   **The Golden Throne**: To return to Sarai and rule the Steppe once more.
*   **Vengeance**: Primarily against Timur (Tamerlane) and the turncoat Edigu.
