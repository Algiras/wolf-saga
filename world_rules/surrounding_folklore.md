# Surrounding Folklore & Mythos

## The Iron Order (The West / Teutonic Lands)
*The Crusaders bring with them the "New Faith", but also their own fears and superstitions.*

### The Patron Saints
*   **The Weeping Mother (Virgin Mary)**: The primary patron. Knights pray to her for protection, believing her tears wash away their sins of war.
*   **Saint Barbara**: Patroness of artillery and those who face sudden death. Invoked before storming walls.
*   **Saint George**: Though less emphasized than the Virgin, he is the dragon-slayer, symbolizing the Order's war against the "Pagan Dragon".

### Superstitions & Beliefs
*   **The Witch's Mark**: They believe the pagan lands are physically tainted. Sudden storms are seen as the work of *Raganas* (witches).
*   **Salt & Iron**: They carry pouches of salt and iron nails to ward off "heathen magic" in the forests.
*   **The 13th Knight**: A superstition that a patrol of 13 knights will never return.
*   **Changelings**: A deep fear that pagan spirits steal Christian babes and replace them with monsters.

## The Rus' Lands (The East / Slavic Borders)
*The vast steppes and forests of the East, where the Old Gods still whisper, but with different names.*

### The Spirits of the Wild
*   **Leshy (The Forest Master)**: A shapeshifter (tall as a tree or small as grass). He protects the forest. Hunters leave him bread and salt on stumps. If angered, he leads travelers in endless circles until they die of exhaustion.
*   **Baba Yaga**: The crone of the woods. She lives in a hut on chicken legs. A terrifying figure of ancient magic, distinct from the Lithuanian *Ragana*.
*   **Domovoy**: The household guardian. He lives behind the stove. If the family is good, he helps; if they are lazy, he breaks things.

### The Borderland Beliefs
*   **Dvoeverie (Double Faith)**: In the conquered Rus' lands, the people go to the Orthodox church by day but leave milk for the *Domovoy* by night. The line between Saint and Spirit is blurred.
