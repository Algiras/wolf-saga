# Sofia of Halshany (The Fourth Queen)

**Title**: Queen of Poland, Grand Duchess of Lithuania
**Era**: Book V (The Invisible Crown)
**Archetype**: The Silent Survivor / The Mother of Kings

## Appearance
*   Youthful (married Jogaila when he was in his 70s).
*   Rus' features—high cheekbones and dark hair.
*   Often seen by the king's side, whispering in his ear.

## Personality
*   **Patient**: She navigated a court that hated her (the Polish lords) and a husband who was nearly four times her age.
*   **Strong-willed**: She was accused of adultery by her rivals (a common political attack) and fought through it with dignity.
*   **Protective**: Her sole focus was ensuring her sons (the future Jagiellonians) inherited the throne.

## Motivation
*   **Succession**: Establishing her sons' legitimacy and dominance in a hostile court.
*   **Survival**: Playing the long game in the shadow of the aging giants Jogaila and Vytautas.
