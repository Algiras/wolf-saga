# Master Series Outline: Geležinio Vilko Saga (The Iron Wolf Saga)

## Theme: The Last Pagan Kingdom
The series explores the collision of two worlds: the ancient, mystical paganism of the Baltic forests and the cold, armored expansion of Christian Europe. It is a story of three cousins (Vytautas, Jogaila, and Skirgaila) whose love and hate for each other shape the map of the continent.
