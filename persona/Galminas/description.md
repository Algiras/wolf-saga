# Galminas (The Samogitian Oak)

**Title**: Elder of Samogitia, Lord of the Forest
**Era**: Books I & IV
**Archetype**: The Indigenous Patriot / The Unyielding Pagan

## Appearance
*   Gnarled and weathered, like the trees of his home.
*   Wears minimal armor—leather and bone—preferring mobility in the dense swamps.
*   His face is tattooed with ancient Baltic symbols of protection.

## Personality
*   **Fierce Independence**: He doesn't care about the "Grand Duchy" or "Poland." He only cares about his land and his groves.
*   **Suspicious**: He views Vytautas's political games with the Christians as a betrayal. "You can wash a wolf, but he remains a wolf; you can baptize a man, but the truth remains in his blood."
*   **Guerrilla Master**: He knows every path, every swamp, and every trap in Samogitia.

## Motivation
*   **Survival of the Way**: Protecting the sacred groves from the axes of the Knights.
*   **Sovereignty**: Ensuring Samogitia remains free from both the Order and the centralizing power of Vilnius.
