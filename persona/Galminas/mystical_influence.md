# Galminas: Mystical Influence

**Patron Force**: The Root-Mother
**Tool of**: Perkūnas

## The Meddling
-   **The Iron-Sense**: Local spirits whisper the "ringing of iron" to Galminas long before the Teutonic scouts arrive. He is never surprised.
-   **The Shifting Swamp**: At Galminas's silent command (granted by the Root-Mother), the ground itself softens beneath the heavy chargers of the Iron Knights.
-   **The Beast-Shift**: In moments of extreme battle-rage, Galminas takes on the attributes of a bear or wolf (Vilkakis), granted by the hungry spirits of the wood.

## Interaction
Galminas doesn't worship the forces; he lives with them. He views himself as part of the Forest's immune system, white-cells fighting off a foreign infection.
