# The Hidden Immortals: Avatars of the Saga

In the "Lithium Thrones" universe, the gods do not just watch—they walk. Certain characters are more than they seem.

## 1. Birutė: The Incarnation of the Amber Queen
*   **The Secret**: Birutė was never a mortal woman. She was the **Amber Queen** herself, taking human form to anchor the pagan faith in the heart of the Grand Duchy.
*   **The Clue**: Her eyes never aged, and she was found on the shore with no father or mother.
*   **The Reveal**: In Book II, when she is "drowned," the water doesn't kill her; it accepts her. Vytis later hears her voice in the waves, confirming her eternal nature.

## 2. Jester Henne: The Shadow-Seller (Velnias)
*   **The Secret**: The jester who follows Vytautas and Sigismund of Luxemburg is actually the **Shadow-Seller** in a manageable human form.
*   **The Clue**: He is seen in the background of every major betrayal, often juggling "three black balls" (representing the cousins).
*   **The Reveal**: In the Congress of Lutsk (Book V), he is the one who "steals" the crown, revealing that the gods never intended for a mortal king to rise above their influence.

## 3. Dievas Senelis: The Wandering Beggar
*   **The Secret**: A recurring old man with a wooden staff who appears to Vytis and Jogaila at their lowest moments.
*   **The Clue**: He asks for a piece of bread and a story. Those who give him bread find their paths cleared; those who refuse find their horses lame.
*   **The Reveal**: He never reveals himself fully, but his footprints in the snow glow with a faint blue light.

## 4. Galminas: The Host of the Root-Mother
*   **The Secret**: Galminas died years ago in a Teutonic raid. The Root-Mother reanimated his body with vines and earth. He is a "Living Alkas" (Sacred Space).
*   **The Clue**: He does not eat or sleep, and his wounds bleed green sap instead of red blood.
*   **The Reveal**: During the Battle of Grunwald, he transforms into a massive, wooden-skinned beast, showing the Order the true "Wild" they tried to conquer.

## 5. Jadwiga: The Relic of the White Silence
*   **The Secret**: She is a "Saint" not by church decree, but because the **White Silence** uses her as a conduit for its cold, purifying light.
*   **The Clue**: Her touch can heal, but it also leaves a faint layer of frost.
*   **The Reveal**: At her death, her body does not decay, but turns into a statue of salt and silver, a permanent anchor for the White Silence in the Polish heartland.
