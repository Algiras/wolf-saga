# Jagelis: Mystical Influence

**Patron Force**: The Shadow-Seller (Velnias)
**Rival Force**: The Root-Mother

## The Meddling
-   **The Pragmatic Voice**: The Shadow-Seller whispers to Jagelis that "betrayal is merely a higher form of loyalty to the future." It provides the logic for the Cross-marriage.
-   **The Silent Grove**: When Jagelis enters a sacred grove, he feels a literal crushing pressure on his chest. The Root-Mother views him as a tumor in her side.
-   **The Crow-Eyes**: Crows often follow Jagelis, observing his every move. He believes they are spies for his enemies, but they are actually the Shadow-Seller's "eyes" making sure he adheres to their deals.

## Interaction
Jagelis is aware of the "bargains" he makes. He believes he is outsmarting the Shadow-Seller, but every victory pulls the thread around his neck tighter.
