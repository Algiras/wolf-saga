# Eglė (The Queen of Serpents)

**True Name**: Eglė
**Divine Status**: Ancient Spirit of the Waters / The Connector
**Role**: The Keeper of the Bridge (Between Humans and Gods)

## The Mythic Role
She is the figure from the "Amber Tears" prologue. While the legend says she turned into a spruce tree, in our story, she is a recurring "Observer." 
*   **The Gap Filler**: She appears at every major turning point (The Fall of Kestus, the Battle of Grunwald, the Death of Vytautas) as a girl with a serpent coiled around her neck.
*   **The Messenger**: She provides the characters with "The Choice"—a warning that if they take the path of blood, the gods will take their piece.

## Interaction
*   **Vytis**: He encounters her in the swamps during his escape. She gives him a piece of amber that "holds the heat of his mother's hand."
*   **Jadwiga**: She appears to Jadwiga in a dream, warning her that "The White Silence will freeze your heart before it saves your soul."
