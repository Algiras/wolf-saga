# Vytis (The Exile)

**True Name**: Vytautas
**Title**: Duke of Trakai, The Wolf's Son
**Age**: 28 (at the start of the Civil War)
**Archetype**: The Honorable Traitor / The Prodigal Prince

## Appearance
*   Dark hair, kept short in the warrior style.
*   Piercing grey eyes, like a winter storm.
*   Strong build, scarred hands from sword training.
*   Often wears a wolf-fur cloak over simple chainmail, eschewing the golden finery of his cousin Jagelis.

## Personality
*   **Honorable but Desperate**: Vytis values his word, but the betrayal by Jagelis forces him to break his own code to survive.
*   **Intense**: He rarely smiles. He carries the weight of his father's legacy and the safety of his people.
*   **Pragmatic Warrior**: Unlike his father, who was stubborn, Vytis is willing to adapt (even using enemy weapons) to win, but he struggles with the moral cost.

## Motivation
*   **Revenge**: Avenging the murder of his father, Kestus.
*   **Restoration**: Reclaiming his birthright and freeing Lithuania from Jagelis's "Polish puppets".
*   **Survival**: Protecting his wife, Anna, and his remaining loyalists.
