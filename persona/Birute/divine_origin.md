# Birutė (The Priestess-Queen)

**True Name**: Birutė
**Divine Origin**: Avatar of the **Amber Queen** (Sea/Memory)
**Archetype**: The Forbidden Love / The Hidden Goddess

## Divine Nature
*   **Sea-Born**: She was found by Palanga fishermen in a sea-cave, wrapped in amber-mesh.
*   **The Eternal Fire**: Her role guarding the flame was a ritual to keep her human form stable.
*   **Memory-Keeper**: She possesses the "Deep Memory," knowing the history of the Baltic tribes before the first stone was laid.

## The Reveal
*   Her "death" in 1382 is a transitional moment. To mortals, she was drowned by Skirgaila. In reality, she walked into the Baltic and shed her human skin.
*   Vytis eventually discovers her "True Shrine" beneath the waves in a vision.
