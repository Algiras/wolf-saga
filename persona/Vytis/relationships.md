# Vytis: Relationships

## Allies (Loyalists)
*   **Anna (Wife)**: His anchor. She saved his life in the dungeon. He trusts her counsel above all others.
*   **Kestus (Father)**: Vytis worshipped him. Kestus's murder is the driving force of Vytis's rage.
*   **The Iron Order (Uneasy Alliance)**: Vytis uses them as a weapon, but he despises them. He knows they want to conquer his home, not liberate it.

## Enemies
*   **Jagelis (Cousin)**: Once a childhood friend, now a mortal enemy. Vytis sees him as a kinslayer and a sellout to foreign powers.
*   **Skirgaila (Cousin)**: Jagelis's brother and enforcer. The one who likely held the rope that killed Kestus. Vytis wants his head.

## Complex
*   **The High Priestess (Eglė)**: She views Vytis as the "Iron Wolf" of prophecy, but she fears his alliance with the Christians will doom the Old Gods.
