# Galminas (The Samogitian Oak)

**Divine Origin**: Host of the **Root-Mother** (Forest Consciousness)
**Archetype**: The Indigenous Patriot / The Wood-Wight

## Divine Nature
*   **Resurrected by Earth**: His heart was pierced by an Iron Knight's spear in youth, but the woods would not let him go. Roots grew through his ribcage, replacing his heart.
*   **Voice of the Forest**: When he speaks, the wind in the trees provides a bass harmony.
*   **Vilkakis (Wolf-Shift)**: He can summon the spirits of the woods to physically distort his body for war.

## The Reveal
*   In the Siege of Kaunas, he is set on fire by pitch but does not burn—he merely smolders like ancient peat, continuing to fight.
