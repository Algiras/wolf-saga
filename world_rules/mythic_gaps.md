# Bridging the Gaps: Mythic Explanations for Historical Mysteries

This document maps the "blind spots" of Lithuanian history to the active meddling of the Meddling Forces.

## 1. The Silence of Kreva (1382)
*   **The Gap**: How was the warrior-giant Kęstutis killed in a high-security dungeon without a struggle being heard?
*   **The Myth**: **The Shadow-Seller** provided Skirgaila with a "Breath of the Void"—a magical silence that dampened all sound in the tower. The murder was committed not by human hands alone, but by a shadow-shadow (a shard of Velnias) that strangled the Duke while the guards slept in an unnatural stupor.

## 2. The Invisible Woman (1382)
*   **The Gap**: Vytautas escaped Kreva dressed in his wife's clothes. How did he pass the elite guards who knew his face well?
*   **The Myth**: **The Amber Queen** (in her human form as Birutė) reached out from the spirit world and cast a "Glimmer of Fog." The guards saw a woman, not because of the clothes, but because the air itself distorted around him, reflecting their own expectations.

## 3. The Overconfidence at Vorskla (1399)
*   **The Gap**: Vytautas was a cautious, brilliant general. Why did he march into a suicidal trap against the Golden Horde?
*   **The Myth**: **The Shadow-Seller** appeared to Vytautas as a "Messenger of the East," bearing a false scroll and a vision of a "Golden Throne in the Clouds." Vytautas was blinded by a divine fever, his tactical mind clouded by a fabricated destiny.

## 4. The Stolen Crown of Lutsk (1430)
*   **The Gap**: A massive royal crown, guarded by a legion of knights, vanished on the road between Hungary and Lithuania. No one was ever prosecuted.
*   **The Myth**: **Jester Henne** (Velnias) didn't just steal the crown; he turned it into a handful of dry leaves. He sat on the roadside and watched the Polish interceptors search a "gold-painted" trunk that was actually empty. The true crown was never meant for the mortal world.

## 5. The Ghost-Fire of Palanga
*   **The Gap**: After the official Christianization, why did the sacred fire at Palanga continue to be seen by travelers for decades?
*   **The Myth**: **The Root-Mother** maintained a "Phantom Flame" that consumed no wood but burned with the memories of the old ways, serving as a beacon for the Samogitian resistance led by Galminas.
