# Birute: Relationships

## Kin
*   **Kestus (Husband)**: He stole her from a shrine, but she came to love him. Together they represented the pure Kernavė paganism.
*   **Vytis (Son)**: She is his moral compass. Even after her death, he feels her presence in the oak groves.

## Rivals
*   **Julianna of Tver**: The Orthodox "other" queen. They represent the two competing futures for Lithuania.

## Legacy
*   **The People**: They view her as a saintly/goddess figure, their "Aisčiai Mary."
