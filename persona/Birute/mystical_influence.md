# Birute: Mystical Influence

**Patron Force**: The Root-Mother / The Amber Queen
**Connection**: Pure / Symbiotic

## The Meddling
-   **The Living Oracle**: Birutė did not just hear the Whispers; she was the Whispers. Her presence in the court acted as a "grounding line" for the pagan forces.
-   **The Eternal Fire**: She was literally psychically linked to the fire at Palanga. When it flickered, she weakened.
-   **Post-Mortem Influence**: Even in death, she appears as a "Lady in White" (Aumakari) in the Samogitian woods, leading Vytis toward the hidden shrines.

## Interaction
She accepted the forces as natural as the wind. She saw her abduction by Kestus as the "Will of the Oak" to bridge the warrior's sword with the priestess's spirit.
