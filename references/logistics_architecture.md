# Historical Reference: Logistics & Architecture

## 1. The "Wege" (The Paths of War)
*   **The Problem**: No stone roads. Spring and Autumn turn the land into impassable mud.
*   **The Strategy**: War is a winter sport. Rivers freeze into "ice highways." Horses pull sleds.
*   **Supply Lines**: Armies largely foraged (burned crops to starve the enemy). Scorched earth was the default defensive tactic.

## 2. Castles & Fortifications
*   **Evolution**: Transition from wooden hill-forts to brick Gothic castles.
*   **Trakai Island Castle**: Started by Kestutis in the late 14th century. The only water castle in Eastern Europe. 2.5m thick walls. Red brick.
*   **Vilnius Upper Castle**: Founded by Gediminas (1323). The capital's heart. Brick octagonal towers.
*   **Construction**: "Gothic red brick," stone foundations, glazed tiles, stained glass.

## 3. The "Wild" (Dykra)
*   **Definition**: The massive depopulated buffer zone between the Teutonic Order and Lithuania.
*   **Landscape**: Impenetrable forests, swamps, and hidden trails known only to locals (The "Wege" guides).
