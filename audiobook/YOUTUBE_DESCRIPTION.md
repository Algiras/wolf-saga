## Description

🎧 **Wolf Saga. Book One: Exile of the Wolf - The Complete Audiobook**

Step into the shadows of the 14th century, where the last pagan kingdom of Europe stands at a crossroads. Guided by the iron will of the Grand Duke Kestutis and haunted by the prophecies of the sacred groves, "Wolf Saga" is an epic journey of betrayal, ancient rituals, and the clash of civilizations.

In this first book of the saga, we witness the internal rot of a crumbling dynasty and the rise of the legendary "Iron Wolf" amidst the smoke of burning forests and the cold steel of the Teutonic Knights.

Written by **Algimantas Krasauskas**.
