# Historical Reference: Warfare (14th Century)

## 1. The Lithuanian Army (The Wolf's Pack)
*   **Composition**: A mix of professional noble cavalry (Boyars) and peasant levies.
*   **Tactics**:
    *   **The Feigned Retreat**: Mastered by the Lithuanians and Tatars (notably at the Battle of Vorskla and Grunwald). Lure heavy knights into disorganized pursuit.
    *   **Light Baltic Cavalry**: Shaggy, resilient horses (Žemaitukai breed). They can cross swamps where heavy European chargers sink.
    *   **Guerilla Defense**: Utilizing the "Wild" (swamps and forests) to bleed out invading columns.
*   **Equipment**: 
    *   Chainmail, lamellar armor (Eastern influence), scale armor.
    *   Pavise shields (large wall-shields for infantry).
    *   Spears, axes, and "bombards" (early gunpowder technology, introduced early 14th century).

## 2. The Iron Order (Teutonic Knights)
*   **Composition**: Highly disciplined monastic knights supported by crusaders from Western Europe (the "Reysen").
*   **Tactics**:
    *   **The Heavy Charge**: Unstoppable on flat, dry ground.
    *   **Engineering Mastery**: Unrivaled in siege warfare. They can dig canals (like at Kaunas 1362) and build massive wooden siege towers.
*   **Technology**: Trebuchets, bombards, crossbows (viciously effective).

## 3. Siege of Kaunas (1362)
*   **Significance**: The first major brick castle of the GDL destroyed.
*   **Scale**: 3,000 Order soldiers vs. 400 Lithuanian defenders under Vaidotas (Kestus's son).
*   **Historical Note**: Use of bombards (gunpowder) by the Order to breach the corner towers.
