# Jagelis: Relationships

## Allergies (Political)
*   **Jadwiga (Wife)**: The young Queen of Poland. Their marriage is purely political. She is pious; he is pragmatic. She holds the keys to his crown.
*   **Skirgaila (Brother)**: His enforcement arm. Brutal and loyal, doing the dirty work Jagelis won't touch.

## Enemies
*   **Vytis (Cousin)**: Jagelis respects Vytis's skill but fears his popularity. He knows Vytis is the only one who can unseat him.
*   **The Teutonic Order**: Despite his conversion, they don't believe him. They are an existential threat.

## Victims
*   **Kestus (Uncle)**: Jagelis saw him as a relic of the past that needed to be removed for progress.
