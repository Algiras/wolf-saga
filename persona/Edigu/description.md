# Edigu (The Steppe Butcher)

**Title**: Emir of the White Horde, Founder of the Nogai Horde
**Era**: Book III (The Iron Wolf's Exile)
**Archetype**: The Tactical Genius / The Chthonic Threat

## Appearance
*   Compact, powerful build. He is a man who "lives on a horse."
*   Sharp, hawk-like features and a thin moustache.
*   Minimalist armor made of hardened leather and iron rings, built for speed.

## Personality
*   **Brilliant Strategist**: The man who defeated Vytautas at the Vorskla River. He understands the terrain and the psychological weaknesses of "Western" knights.
*   **Ruthless**: He doesn't seek glory, only results. He views the Lithuanian expansion as a nuisance to be swatted.
*   **Loyal (to the Steppe)**: He cares for the strength of the Horde, but is willing to use any Khan as a puppet.

## Motivation
*   **Steppe Mastery**: To prevent any Western power (Lithuania or Russia) from encroaching on Mongol lands.
*   **Destruction of Rivals**: Systematically hunting down Tokhtamysh and his lineage.
