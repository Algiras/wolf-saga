# Zbigniew Olesnicki (The Cardinal-King)

**Title**: Bishop of Kraków, Cardinal
**Era**: Books IV & V
**Archetype**: The Religious Oligarch / The Shadow Regent

## Appearance
*   Usually dressed in his crimson clerical robes, but carries himself like a general.
*   Sharp, clean-shaven face with deep-set, intelligent eyes.
*   He is said to have "the cross in his hand and the sword in his heart."

## Personality
*   **Nationalist**: He believes Poland should be the dominant partner in the union. He deeply distrusts the Lithuanian "pagan" spirit.
*   **Inflexible**: Once he sets a course (like denying Vytautas the crown), he will not be moved by gold or threats.
*   **Guardian**: He served Jogaila faithfully but essentially took over the government as the king aged.

## Motivation
*   **Polish Supremacy**: Annexing Lithuania and Ruthenia into the Polish Crown.
*   **Catholic Orthodoxy**: Opposing the Hussites and ensuring the "New Faith" is the only law.
