# Mystical Mechanics: The Whispers & The Signs

How the Meddling Forces interact with the world of men.

## 1. The Whispers
Most mortals only hear "The Whispers" in the space between waking and sleep. 
-   **The Echo**: A character hears their own voice repeating a dark thought. (Velnias)
-   **The Wind-Talk**: A character hears a warning in the rustle of leaves. (The Root-Mother)

## 2. The Signs
Physical manifestions that direct the flow of history.
-   **The Blood-Sign**: Sap turning to blood (A warning of impending massacre).
-   **The Frozen Shield**: Salt or water freezing in an impossible shape.
-   **The Crow-Guidance**: Birds leading an army into an ambush or a vital clearing.

## 3. The Price
Magic is never free. Every "miracle" demands a cost:
-   **The Root-Price**: Offering hair, blood, or a beloved item to a sacred oak.
-   **The Spirit-Debt**: A slowly encroaching madness or a "stolen" memory in exchange for a vision.
