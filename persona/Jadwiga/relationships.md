# Jadwiga: Relationships

## Kin (Political)
*   **Jagelis**: Her husband. Their relationship began in cold duty but grew into a deep, respectful partnership.
*   **Elizabeth of Bosnia**: Her mother, a tragic figure herself.

## Rivals (Spiritual/Political)
*   **The Teutonic Order**: She exposes their hypocrisy; she is a "more Christian" figure than the knights themselves.
*   **Vytis**: She respects him and acts as a mediator between him and Jogaila.

## Lost Love
*   **William of Austria**: The childhood betrothed she was forced to send away.
    *   *Dramatic Moment*: He supposedly tried to sneak into Wawel Castle to rescue her, but she turned him away for her crown.
