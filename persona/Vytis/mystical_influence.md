# Vytis: Mystical Influence

**Patron Force**: The Amber Queen (The Memory of the Sea)
**Tormentor Force**: Perkūnas (The Storm-Force)

## The Meddling
-   **The Vision**: Vytis receives visions of his father's spirit wandering the amber shores. This keeps his grief fresh and his rage focused.
-   **The Storm-Wall**: Whenever Vytis tries to make a purely pragmatic choice that betrays his pagan roots, a storm breaks his ranks. Perkūnas "punishes" his alliances with the Christians.
-   **The Exile's Luck**: In the forests, the Root-Mother naturally hides his trail from his enemies, even when he doesn't ask. He is "Son of the Woods" regardless of his baptism.

## Interaction
Vytis resents the forces. He wants to be a "modern" man like his cousin, but his blood is tied to the ancient soils. He views the Whispers as a curse of the mind.
