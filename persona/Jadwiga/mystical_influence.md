# Jadwiga: Mystical Influence

**Patron Force**: The White Silence (The Twined Saint)
**Conflict**: The Amber Queen (Memories of Lost Love)

## The Meddling
-   **The Burning Cross**: In her prayers, Jadwiga sees a cross of fire that points towards the North. She believes it is a holy command; the Forces know it is a beacon for destruction.
-   **The Blinding Light**: During diplomatic meetings, she sometimes emanates a light that compels others to tell the truth—a terrifying "political weapon."
-   **The Salt-Tears**: Her grief for her lost love is harvested by the Amber Queen, who uses it to create amber pearls that appear on the Baltic shores, linking the Polish queen to the pagan sea.

## Interaction
Jadwiga is a "Saint" in the making, but she doesn't realize that the "White Silence" which guides her is as cold and ruthless as the "Root-Mother" she fears.
